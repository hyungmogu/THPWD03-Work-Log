# THPWD03 - Work Log

This is the third project to team tree house's Python Web Tech Degree.

## Goal
- Build a CLI (command line interface) application that logs what a person has done on a specific day.

## Deliverables / Objectives
1. Script must runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
2. As a user of the script, a menu should be prompted to choose whether to add a new entry or lookup previous entries.
3. As a user of the script, a task name, a number of minutes spent working on it, and any additional notes must be provided when adding an entry.
4. As a user of the script, search page should presented with four options:
    - find by date
    - find by time spent
    - find by exact search
    - find by pattern
5. When finding by date, user should be able to see a list of dates with entries, and should be presented with options to be able to choose one to see entries from.
6. When finding by time spent, user should be allowed to enter the number of minutes a task took and be able to choose one to see entries from.
7. When finding by an exact string, user should be allowed to enter a string and then be presented with entries containing that string in the task name or notes.
8. When finding by a pattern, user should be allowed to enter a regular expression and then be presented with entries matching that pattern in their task name or notes.
9. When displaying the entries, the entries should be displayed in a readable format with the date, task name, time spent, and notes information.
